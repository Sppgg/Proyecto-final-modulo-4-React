## Introduction
This project is a responsive front-end web application built with React. It simulates an online smart home store where users can browse a list of smart home products, view product details, and manage a shopping cart. The project integrates local storage and a fake API call using mock data.

---

## Objectives
- **React Fundamentals:** Implement functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useParams`), and routing with React Router.
- **Global State Management:** Use Context API with `useReducer` for managing the shopping cart state.
- **Fake API Integration:** Simulate API calls by fetching product data from local storage, with fallback to a fake API call.
- **Responsive Design:** Create a user-friendly interface with separate CSS files for modular styling.

## Features
- **Home Page (`/`):**  
  Displays a grid of smart home products with images, names, and prices.
- **Product Details (`/product/:id`):**  
  Shows detailed information of the selected product retrieved via URL parameters.
- **Shopping Cart (`/cart`):**  
  Allows adding and removing products, with global state management via Context API.
- **Fake API Call & Local Storage:**  
  The `useProducts` hook fakes an API call with a delay using `setTimeout`. It checks local storage for data and, if absent, stores the mock product data.
- **Modular CSS:**  
  Each component has its own CSS file under the `styles/` directory for better maintainability.

---

## Technologies Used
- **React & React Router:** For building the UI and managing navigation.
- **Hooks & Context API:** For local and global state management.
- **Local Storage:** To simulate API data caching.
- **CSS:** Modular styling with separate CSS files for each component.
- **Vite (optional):** For a fast development server and build tool.
