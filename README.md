## Introduction

Smart Home Store is a project designed to showcase the following:

- **React fundamentals**: Functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`), and Context API.
- **Global state management**: Managing a shopping cart and user authentication with local storage.
- **UI/UX principles**: Modularized components with individual styling for maintainability and scalability.
- **Protected routing**: Restricting access to certain pages based on user authentication status.

---

## Features

### General Features

- **Product Catalog**: Browse a diverse selection of smart home devices, with detailed descriptions and responsive layouts.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, increment, or decrement product quantities. Cart total is dynamically updated.
- **User Authentication**: Users must log in to access the appâ€™s features. A dummy account (`username: admin`, `password: admin`) is pre-configured for demo purposes.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain pages are accessible only when logged in.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Login session is persisted even after refreshing the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing.
- **Context API**: State management for shopping cart and authentication.
- **CSS**: Component-level styles for modularity and scalability.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting login state across sessions.
- **React Icons**: For visually appealing and intuitive UI elements.
